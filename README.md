## Data and viz of interest

### Journal or newspaper article that relates data science to a humanities  with visualization 

[AI that can learn the patterns of human language](https://news.mit.edu/2022/ai-learn-patterns-language-0830).
I'm intersted in making chatbots that are capable of talking as good as humans, and eventually maybe even pass the Turing test. I think humans are predictable to a good degree and machine learning will be able to predict us very well in future.

I came a cross a network visulization in another class and recently learned about this field of mathmathics. I find network visulization to be very engaging and great for quickly detecting how different nodes releate to one another.

## Ideas for data to investigate

### Some topics and ctivites that appealed to me 

* I'm intersted in histroy, espically the rise and fall of kingdoms and how did the rulers rule.
* I want to understand how humans think.
* I find philosophy fascinating and the question of existence is something we all deal with.

The activity that most appeals is Web Scraping. I have scrapped jobs Web from Indeed before. It is a good way to utilize information of other sites and the aggregating data in the way we want.

1. [Explaining how the mind works: A new theory](https://researchoutreach.org/articles/explaining-mind-works-new-theory/)
2. [Descartes’ Ontological Argument](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-ontological/)
3. [How to Scrape Indeed.com](https://scrapfly.io/blog/how-to-scrape-indeedcom/)



## Ideas from curated datasets & project lists

| Name              | Description        | Link  |
|:-----------------:|:------------------:|:-----:|
|University Data Set|This data set contains the number of applicants & enrolled, locations, and other relevant information about many universities in the United States. I would investigate how much location matters in the number of applications received by a university|https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/University|
Sentiment Labelled Sentences Data Set|For each website of imdb.com, amazon.com, and yelp.com, there are 500 positive and 500 negative sentences assigned with scores of 1 and 0. I think it would be an good dataset to train a model for comment classification|https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Sentiment+Labelled+Sentences|
US cabinet appointments|This dataset contains the name of cabinet members and their years of service. We can see how often cabinet members changed under different presidents(maybe it will tell us something interesting)|https://github.com/taitcha/American_cabinet_appointments|
|Social Scientists Before Congress for years 1946-2016| Data describing when social scientists testified before congress from 1946-2016, who those social scientists were, the hearings they testified at, and characteristics of those hearings, such as the congressional committees that convened them|https://osf.io/e3h98/

#### I'm likely to use Social scientists’ testimony before Congress in the United States between 1946-2016 dataset for my final project
